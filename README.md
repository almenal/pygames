# pygames
Small videogames written in python using the pygame library. For now, these games are available:

| __Game__ | __Status__ | __Description__ |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
|**Pong** | **stable** | 2 bars, 1 ball, you know how it goes |
|**4elements** | **developing** | Long-term project. It will be a sort-of RPG, hopefully with a long story with decisions |
| Tests | - | various tests I used for myself to understand better how pygame works (they all end with -test.py) |

Feel free to copy the code and leave an issue if you have a suggestion!
