                   Game script

I want this game to be about exploring dungeons and fighting enemies. I will add a story eventually, but for now it will just be a simple game. The game will be developed in a series of chapters. The chapters will depend on the player's choices, and will be saved right after making the decision. If the player dies and returns where they left the game, the decision will have already been taken and the history will develop accordingly.

# Lore:
    There are 4 realms on an island, each of them devoted to one of the 4 elements: fire, wind, earth and water.
    The water people live at the shore of the island, at the delta of the river Qui. They are slim, blue beings, whose bodies are made of flowing water. They feed off the water, though never still ones, for their water needs flow, as well as fish at times. They get along with the earth people from the forest, since they bring water to their trees in times of draught. But this alliance is fragile. The water people are meant to flow, and that applies to both their bodies and minds. They can switch currents of thought and become hostile. One can perhaps predict the next move of this folk, but you can never be too sure about next week. This is why they tend to stick to small fishermen settlements on the shores. They can move through water very quickly, so whenever they need to go the neighbour town, they just swim there and back, which is why no roads connect them.
    The earth people are bulky, brown beings, with pieces of leaves and twigs on their bodies. Although they're called earth people, they embody the soul of the forests. They live on hoods on the top of the trees, as well as in underground caves. They are robust, resilient and not too prone to change. Probably they're homophobic. But since they tend to building long-lasting societies, they possess the biggest and strongest of structures. Huge castles, entire cities on the top of trees, never-ending underground galleries that go deep into the earth.
    The fire people have fast-paced lifestyle that leads to its early consumption. They live around the island's central volcano. It's mostly asleep, but has a crater where one can feel the warm lava (or is it magma?) deep down in the chimney. They are intense people. They feel, act and think impulsively and intensely. Every other day they have a celebration around the volcano they worship, where they gather and party, brawl and live like there's no tomorrow. They are powerful, and the evil people among them are to be feared. But even the most evil of them is incapable of building a tyranny that could pose a threat to the rest of the island. They either get bored too soon or die stupidly in a celebration. They are also the most diverse in terms of shapes. They basically look like flames, but just like real flames, some of them are flat and thick, like a campfire, others slim and still like a match, while others are gray and red rocks, like magma itself. Their lifespan is short, and they constantly need to be fed to survive.
    Finally, there is the air people. Mysterious eagle-shaped creatures that form small clans dispersed all over the island. They are mostly seen from afar, high in the sky, when they fly around the island. They rarely talk to the other folks, and no-one knows if they talk to each other. The astounding truth is that they are highly hierarchical people, who communicate constantly in sky meetings, where they share orders, situation reports and other updates. They do live apart from each other, each family settling on their own tree or cave or rock, normally far away from other families. But their capability of moving fast across the island makes up for the distance. Our Player belongs to this folk. They is a young captain, who has been recently promoted for their remarkable performance at a skirmish with some hostile water people.

    # EDIT: No island, just a piece of the world!!

    The world as they know it is about to change. The shadow of war peeks on the verge of the southwest forest, where a settlement of an unknown folk that worship iron has shown to be a tiny part of a bigger, hostile empire. An explorer's team of the air folk commanded by Player, has been given the mission to infiltrate and neutralize a nearby stronghold that was the source of many spies that had been spotted on the earth land.

# First chapter:
- In-media-res flashback, player infiltrates the enemy stronghold and gets captured
- One dungeon, static screen, 5 enemies placed at specific positions
- Introduce game mechanics:
    - move (shift + move = slow movement), jump (double jump?)
    - vertical stairs?
    - melee attack
        - initially, only one weapon. Later, introduce variety of weapons with stats
    - ranged attack
        - Mana-fueled bullets/arrows, slowly recharges over time but fills up quicker in mana fonts
- Enemies should be tough: shield + spear, only vulnerable in the back
    -> either sneak attack when they're facing away from player
    -> or surround enemy while in combat
- After killing enemies and completing dungeon, next screen is FULL of enemies
    -> scene where Player drops weapons and kneels: game 'starts'

# Second chapter:
- A Friend (fire folk) sneaks in and frees Player, who recovers armor and weapons gradually
- Initial goal is not to get killed, but after weapon recovery Player kills again
- Friend may die tragically at the end of chapter
-> First dilemma:
 Enemy Commander declares its intentions of conquering the realms of earth people. Player and Friend are offered the possibility of joining the iron empire against their own, in exchange of power. Friend opposes firmly and violently, but Player is given a choice: kill Friend or kill Commander.
 [DECISION 2.1: KILL COMMANDER OR KILL FRIEND]
    a) Kill commander
    -> Survival of Friend (which depends on Player's skills) influences the course of the game
        - 0: If Friend survives, commander dies, Player and Friend return to base camp to report. War continues, getting closer to a direct clash against the iron folk.
        - 1: If Friend dies, Player is offered again to join forces with iron folk. Player can then choose to kill Commander or join him.
        [DECISION 2.1.1: SURRENDER & JOIN COMMANDER OR KILL COMMANDER & Co]
           a) Surrender & join commander
           - The Player joins the iron folk as an untrustworthy middle-rank soldier. The commander accepts them but does not trust them. No leadership missions granted, rarely trusted but can regain trust
           b) Kill commander: same as 2.1.a.0

    b) Kill Friend
    - Player recruited by iron-folk empire, brought to iron-folk fortress.

### All Possible outcomes of chapter:
    2A - Friend alive, both return to base camp
    2B - Friend killed by Player, brought to iron-folk fortress by Commander
    2C - Friend died in combat, Player surrenders and join Commander

# Third chapter:
    ## 2A
